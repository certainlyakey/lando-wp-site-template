# Lando Wordpress site template

A no-frills boilerplate Timber-based Wordpress project template for theme development using [Lando](https://lando.dev) v3.x.

You can add any theme to it.

It's meant to be used with [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/), so that dependency is baked in.

## Installation

1. Install Lando 3.x and its prerequisites
2. Clone this repo and `cd` to the repo folder
3. Create an `.env` file and add your ACF Pro key here as `ACF_PRO_KEY`
4. Run `lando start`
5. Once finished, run `lando wpinstall` â€” this will perform an automated install of Wordpress, activate all plugins and install a default theme (twentytwenty). 

Next add your own theme in the mix. After installing it to the `themes` folder, replace lando-wp-site-theme with your theme name in all files across this repo (`.gitignore`, `.lando.yml`). 

## Installation info and default credentials

Core Wordpress is installed into `/wp` folder, and all content goes into `/wp-content`. Couldn't be simpler!

Default credentials are the same as in the original [Lando Wordpress recipe](https://docs.lando.dev/config/wordpress.html) by default.

## Installation on server

Add a `wp-config.php` file to a parent folder of the installation and define database connection constants, salts, table prefix there. 

Also add a `WP_CONTENT_DIR` constant to the `wp-config.php` file, pointing to the `/wp-content` folder (the path must be absolute), and `WP_CONTENT_URL` with an absolute URL (eg. `https://example.com/wp-content`).

Don't forget to `require_once` composer's `autoload.php` and load `.env` via [Dotenv class](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv).

You can omit the "Happy publishing!" part.

You should also add an `index.php` to the parent folder with an updated path to `wp-blog-header.php` file.

## Connecting to MySQL externally

Use port `32841` to connect to the database externally (eg. with [Sequel Ace](https://github.com/Sequel-Ace/Sequel-Ace)).

## Miscellaneous

Keep in mind that you must include Timber in your theme in order for it to work: 

```
$composer_autoload = __DIR__ . '/../../vendor/autoload.php';
if ( file_exists( $composer_autoload ) ) {
	require_once $composer_autoload;
	$timber = new Timber\Timber();
}
```
